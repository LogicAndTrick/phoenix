# Phoenix MVC

Phoenix is a PHP MVC framework that attempts to emulate the powerful simplicity of the ASP.NET MVC framework.

This repo has the following subfolders:

* `App` - Contains controllers, models, views, and helpers
* `Content` - Contains images, styles and scripts
* `Phoenix` - Contains the framework files

This is a suggested structure only and these three folders can be moved if required. The `index.php` file needs to be configured appropriately. See the [documentation][1] for more information.
